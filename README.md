Simple peer-to-peer chat.

General architecture pattern -- MVC. I use google protobuf for messaging, gRPC to show that the other user is currently typing. For UI I use JavaFX.

Initially the code was located here: https://github.com/equivalence1/SofwareDesign2016/tree/task13_grpc but I decided to move it in a separate repository.
